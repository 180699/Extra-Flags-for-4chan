Extra Flags for /int/
==========

We're in BETA! Bugs will occur.

Install this: https://github.com/flaghunters/Extra-Flags-for-int-/raw/master/Extra%20Flags%20for%20int.user.js

The first time it will try geolocation, and then ask if you need to edit the region.

To set the region later:
 - greasemonkey: monkey menu > User script commands > Extra flags for /int/
 - tampermonkey: tampermonkey menu > Extra flags for /int/

HOW TO INSTALL
==========

1. Download GreaseMonkey for Firefox or TamperMonkey for Chrome.
2. Install flags script from link above

Works with:
 - **Vanilla 4chan** (inline extension) (Currently doesn't work on Firefox versions older than 29, use a 4chan x script for those)
 - ~~**appchan** (very ricy) https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x~~ (currently untested)
 - **ccd0's 4chan X** (ricy) https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x
 - **loadletter's 4chan x v2** (least bloated) https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x/

It also mostly works on safari with ninjakit, but to set the region you will need to edit it in the script, like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flaghunters/Extra-Flags-for-int-/master/flags_guide.png

Tested on latest Firefox/Chromium and firefox 24 on debian and latest Firefox/Chrome/Safari5 on Windows.
