Works with:
 - **Vanilla 4chan** (inline extension)
 - **appchan** (very ricy) https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x (**Bug:** JSON navigation prevents the extra flags from showing until you refresh!)
 - **ccd0's 4chan X** (ricy) https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x
 - **loadletter's 4chan x v2** (least bloated) https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x/
